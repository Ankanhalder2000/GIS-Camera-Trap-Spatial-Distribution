# Camera Trap Spatial Distribution Mapping (QGIS)

## Project Overview
This project presents a GIS-based spatial visualization of camera trap observations.
Using cleaned point data, the project maps the spatial distribution of wildlife detections
to understand clustering patterns and spatial arrangement of camera trap records.

The project is designed as a continuation of a Python-based data cleaning and analysis workflow.

## Objectives
- Visualize camera trap point locations in a GIS environment
- Assess spatial clustering and distribution patterns
- Produce a clean map layout
- Prepare data for further spatial analysis in future GIS projects

## Data Source
The spatial point data used in this project was generated and cleaned in:

**Python Project  — Camera Trap Data Analysis**  
🔗 https://github.com/Ankanhalder2000/camera-trap-data-analysis

Only cleaned and GIS-ready CSV files were used for mapping.

## Software & Tools
- QGIS 3.34.1 (Prizren)
- OpenStreetMap (basemap)
- CSV point data (latitude–longitude)

All tools and datasets used are open-source and free.


## Key Outputs
- Spatial distribution map of camera trap observations
- GIS-ready project file (.qgz)
- Exported map layout with legend, scale bar, and north arrow

##  **Download the final release of the GIS Camera Trap Spatial Distribution project:** [v1.0 – Camera Trap Spatial Distribution Map — QGIS](https://github.com/Ankanhalder2000/GIS-Camera-Trap-Spatial-Distribution/releases/tag/v1.0)




> Notes on Data Visualization : The camera trap points show strong clustering along a linear feature.
This reflects the structure of the original sampling design and is intentionally preserved
to maintain data integrity.
